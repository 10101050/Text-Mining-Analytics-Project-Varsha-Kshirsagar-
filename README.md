#Aim

The goal of Text Mining is to essentially turn Text Into Data for Analysis With Applying Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Anlytics Methods.

#Objectives

The Widely used in knowledge-driven organizations, text mining is the process of examining large collections of documents to discover new information or help answer specific research questions. Text mining identifies facts, relationships and assertions that would otherwise remain buried in the mass of textual big data.

#Methodology

Text Mining Analysis is a machine learning technique used to automatically extract valuable insights from unstructured text data. Companies use text analysis tools to quickly digest online data and documents, and transform them into actionable insights.
Data Collection: Collecting Data in Text Format from www.google.com
On That Data performed Various In Natural Language Toolkit the Operation is Tokenization, Frequency Distribution, Stop words , Removing Words, Stemming ,Lemmatization ,POS Tagging, Bag of Words etc.

#Tools and Technology Used

Python and Natural Language Toolkit or Natural Language Processeing.
Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries: nltk, Matplotlib, word_tokenize, sent_tokenize, Stopwords, PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer , CountVectorizer

#Text Mining Techniques
